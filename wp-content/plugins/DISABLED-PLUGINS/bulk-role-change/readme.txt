Transfer all users from one role to another.

== Description ==

This plugin has been developed by WEBxMedia LTD to enable the transfer of users belonging to one WordPress role to another. This plugin originated from the need to move a group of users to a new role, as the existing role was being demoted (reduced permissions) for new user sign-ups. It's simple and straightforward to use, and we have plans to enhance this plugin to enable more granular control over which users are transferred.
