Move comments between posts or pages.

== Description ==

WordPress does not have an option to move comments between posts or pages. Move Comments is a WordPress plugin that allows comments to be moved from one page or post to another.

It adds a section under 'Comments' where you can filter comments by post or page title, tick the ones you want to move and finally select where to move them to.


== ChangeLog ==


Version 1.2
* The interface is now with 2.7 look and feel.
* Fixed the bug where items whose status was not 'publish' was appearing on the drop-down list.
* Re-arranged the interface.
* The plugin is now located under the Comments section on WP 2.7


== Installation ==

Extract the download on your computer and upload the move-comments folder to wp-content/plugins/. Finally, enable the plugin from the 'Plugins' page.


== Submit a Problem or Feature Request ==

If you have spotted a problem with the plugin or have an idea for a new feature, then please submit it to [Bugtracker](http://bugtracker.dountsis.com/ "Bugtracker at Dountsis.com") rather than posting a comment in the web site.

Don’t forget to include as much information as possible and check whether someone else has submitted the same issue before you press the submit button.
