Convert Experiences provides advanced A/B and MVT Testing functionality for your website or blog.

== Description ==

A/B testing for WordPress now possible and simple.
It will enable your WordPress installation for use with the Convert Experiences conversion optimization suite.

The plugin will automatically send the page type, page name, category name, category ID, and tags to Convert Experiences.
A/B testing on any set of categories or pages is then easy with the advanced filtering and segmentation during test
configuration.

> You'll need a [Convert Experiences account](http://www.convert.com/pricing/) to use this plugin.  Once you have that,  A/B tests are easy to
> setup without any technical knowledge. 

<h4>What does the plugin do?</h4>

At a high level, this plugins sole purpose is to quickly install a small block of javascript onto each page of your
WordPress installation. The installed javascript is necessary for the Convert Experiences suite to perform its
A/B, split URL and multivariate functionality on your blog.

With some slight variations (based on the type of page being viewed: home, single, category, tag, or page), the
inserted javascript will look like the following:

`<!-- begin Convert Experiments code--><script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn-3.convertexperiments.com/js/1-4.js"></script><!-- end Convert Experiments code -->`
